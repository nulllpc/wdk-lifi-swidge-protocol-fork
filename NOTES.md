# Implementation Notes — `LifiSwidgeProtocol`

This document explains every non-obvious implementation decision in `LifiSwidgeProtocol`.

---

## How the module fits into WDK

```
SwidgeProtocol (base, @tetherto/wdk-wallet)
  implements ISwapProtocol + IBridgeProtocol
  └── LifiSwidgeProtocol  — LI.FI, HTTP-based routing
```

Because `SwidgeProtocol` already satisfies both `ISwapProtocol` and `IBridgeProtocol`, a wallet wiring in `LifiSwidgeProtocol` gets swap, bridge, and combined cross-chain swap+bridge from one module. We implement all five abstract methods (`quoteSwidge`, `swidge`, `getSwidgeStatus`, `getSupportedChains`, `getSupportedTokens`) and do not override the four legacy delegation methods — those are handled entirely by the base class.

The module accepts all three constructor shapes the interface contract requires: a full writable account, a read-only account, or no account at all (for discovery and quote-only use). Calling `swidge()` without a writable account throws `LifiReadOnlyAccountError` immediately, before any API call or transaction attempt.

---

## Legacy delegation

The base class implements `bridge()`, `quoteBridge()`, `swap()`, and `quoteSwap()` by mapping their options into `SwidgeOptions` and delegating to our `swidge()` / `quoteSwidge()`. It extracts `fee` (network fees) and `bridgeFee` (protocol fees) from the returned `SwidgeFee[]` array. Any wallet using the legacy API continues to work without changes, and the test suite covers all four delegation paths.

---

## Fee structure

Fees are always returned as a populated `SwidgeFee[]` array. There is no aggregated fee field.

| LI.FI field | `SwidgeFeeType` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `estimate.gasCosts[].type === 'SEND'` | `'network'` | Gas for the bridge tx itself |
| `estimate.feeCosts[]` | `'protocol'` | LI.FI's own fee, deducted from bridged amount |
| `estimate.gasCosts[].type === 'APPROVE'` | excluded | May not be paid if allowance is already sufficient |

`APPROVE`-type costs are excluded because including them would inflate the quoted fee for wallets that already have a valid allowance.

**Denomination matters.** `network` fees are in native token wei (ETH, MATIC); `protocol` fees are in source token base units. The `token` field on each fee entry identifies which denomination applies. Wallet UIs need to handle both when rendering.

**Fee caps** (`maxNetworkFeeBps`, `maxProtocolFeeBps`) are in basis points of the input amount and checked after the quote, before any transaction. Protocol fees use a direct bigint comparison since they share the source token's denomination. Network fees require a USD-based comparison because gas is in native token while the input is in the source token — we use the USD values LI.FI includes in the quote response for this.

---

## Status mapping

| LI.FI `status` | LI.FI `substatus` | `SwidgeStatus` |
|---|---|---|
| `PENDING` | any | `'pending'` |
| `DONE` | `COMPLETED` | `'completed'` |
| `DONE` | `PARTIAL` | `'partial'` |
| `DONE` | `REFUNDED` | `'refunded'` |
| `DONE` | `NOT_PROCESSABLE_REFUND_NEEDED` | `'refund-pending'` |
| `FAILED` | any | `'failed'` |
| any | — | `'action-required'` if `requiredActions.length > 0` |
| `NOT_FOUND` or `INVALID` | — | throws `LifiStatusError` |

`NOT_FOUND` and `INVALID` throw rather than return a status — they indicate a bad `id` or a transaction not yet indexed, both developer-actionable conditions. No status values beyond the nine defined in the interface are returned.

---

## Cross-chain token resolution

`SwidgeCommonOptions` requires both `fromToken` and `toToken`. For a bridge-only operation the natural thing is to pass the same address for both, but token addresses differ per chain (USDT on Arbitrum is not the same contract as USDT on Optimism). Passing the source chain's address as `toToken` on a cross-chain route causes LI.FI to reject the quote.

When `fromToken === toToken` and the chains differ, `_resolveToToken` loads source token metadata from LI.FI, then searches the destination chain for a stablecoin with matching decimals (trying the source symbol, `coinKey`, and a `{symbol}0` variant). The highest-market-cap match is used as `toToken` (contract address). This handles rebranded destination tokens such as Ethereum USDT → Arbitrum USDT0, where passing the source symbol alone would fail. The method throws if no match is found rather than falling back silently.

This also fires automatically when the base class `bridge()` delegation calls `swidge()`, since the base class passes `toToken = fromToken` for bridge-only routes.

---

## ERC-20 approval handling

Every `swidge()` call determines the required approval calls with `_buildApprovalTxs` before submitting the source operation. There are four outcomes:

1. **Skip** — LI.FI's `skipApproval` flag is set (native tokens, some CCTP routes).
2. **Already approved** — current on-chain allowance ≥ amount. No transaction.
3. **Clean approval** — `currentAllowance === 0n`. One `approve(spender, amount)` tx.
4. **Reset then approve** — `0 < currentAllowance < amount`. First `approve(spender, 0)`, then `approve(spender, amount)`. USDT on Ethereum mainnet reverts on a direct non-zero-to-non-zero allowance change. We apply this defensively for any token in that state.

**Why exact amount, not infinite:** An upgradeable bridge contract with `type(uint256).max` approval is a standing permission to drain the wallet. Exact-amount approval limits exposure to only the tokens in the current operation.

**EOA confirmation:** `_handleApproval` sends each required approval as a separate transaction and calls `provider.waitForTransaction` before sending the next approval or the bridge transaction. Without the wait, the LI.FI Diamond can execute `safeTransferFrom` before the allowance is confirmed.

**ERC-4337 batching:** ERC-4337 accounts submit the optional allowance reset, approval, and bridge call together with `account.sendTransaction([...approvalTxs, bridgeTx], config)`. Previously, approval and bridge calls were submitted as separate UserOperations without waiting for the first one to be included. Both could be estimated with the same Safe nonce, causing the bundler to reject the bridge operation with `AA25 invalid account nonce`. Sending one ordered Safe batch removes that nonce race, executes all calls atomically, and avoids leaving an approval behind when bridge estimation fails.

**Approval address comes from the quote** (`estimate.approvalAddress`), never hardcoded. LI.FI deploys the Diamond to different addresses on some chains.

## Account type detection — why we don't use instanceof

Two things depend on account type: the `_isWritableAccount` guard on `swidge()` and the `_isErc4337Account` branch that batches approval and bridge calls into one UserOperation. The obvious approach — `instanceof WalletAccountEvmErc4337` — breaks when the same package resolves to two different module instances in a monorepo (workspace root vs nested `node_modules`). JavaScript compares constructor identity in memory, so two installs of identical source produce two different constructor objects and `instanceof` returns `false` for valid accounts.

We walk the prototype chain and compare constructor names as strings instead:

```js
_isErc4337Account() {
  let proto = this._account
  while (proto && proto !== Object.prototype) {
    if (proto.constructor?.name === 'WalletAccountEvmErc4337') return true
    proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(proto)
  }
  return false
}
```

Constructor names survive across module instances and are immune to dual-install issues.

## Typed error classes

| Class | Thrown when |
|---|---|
| `LifiConfigurationError` | Missing provider, bad config |
| `LifiQuoteError` | LI.FI quote, token, chains, or tokens API error |
| `LifiExecutionError` | Fee cap exceeded before any tx is sent |
| `LifiStatusError` | Status API error, or `NOT_FOUND`/`INVALID` id |
| `LifiReadOnlyAccountError` | `swidge()` called without a writable account |
| `LifiUnsupportedChainError` | Unknown chain name string passed as `toChain` |
| `LifiTimeoutError` | Request exceeded the configured timeout |
| `LifiNetworkError` | Network failure persisted after retries |
| `LifiRateLimitError` | 429 persisted after retries |
| `LifiSlippageError` | 409 from `/quote` — extends `LifiQuoteError` |
| `LifiValidationError` | Bad user input or malformed API response |
| `LifiUntrustedContractError` | Allowlist rejection — extends `LifiExecutionError` |

All extend `LifiProtocolError`. The split between user-actionable errors (`LifiReadOnlyAccountError`, `LifiUnsupportedChainError`) and developer errors lets wallet UIs surface appropriate messages rather than raw stack traces. `LifiSlippageError` and `LifiUntrustedContractError` subclass existing families so pre-existing `catch` blocks keep working.

---

## HTTP reliability layer

All six API call sites go through `request()` in `src/request.js`, modeled on the LI.FI SDK's `request()` wrapper (`packages/sdk/src/utils/request.ts`) and its status-code classification (`packages/sdk/src/errors/httpError.ts`). The SDK is a code reference only — the Tether contributor requirement is API-based with no SDK dependency.

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Network error / timeout | Retry with backoff; exhausted → `LifiNetworkError` / `LifiTimeoutError` |
| 429 | Retry after `Retry-After` (capped at 60s) or backoff; exhausted → `LifiRateLimitError` |
| 5xx | Retry with backoff; exhausted → endpoint error class (`LifiQuoteError` / `LifiStatusError`) |
| 409 | `LifiSlippageError` immediately — a stale quote cannot succeed by retrying the same URL |
| Any other non-OK (incl. missing status) | Endpoint error class immediately, preserving the pre-existing message shape |

Defaults: 30s timeout per attempt, 1 retry (mirrors the SDK's `requestSettings.retries`), 500ms base backoff doubled per attempt and capped at 5s.

**Why `Promise.race` for timeouts:** the timeout uses `AbortController` *and* a racing rejection. Bare runtime fetch polyfills and test mocks may ignore the abort signal entirely; the race guarantees the timeout fires regardless. The timer is cleared in `finally` so no handles leak.

**Why a missing status code is non-retryable:** a response with `ok: false` but no `status` cannot be classified as transient, so it fails immediately with the endpoint's error class. This also keeps the error-path behavior identical for any consumer (or test) constructing minimal response objects.

**Status polling:** `getSwidgeStatus` throws on `NOT_FOUND`/`INVALID` (unchanged), but the error now carries `err.lifiStatus` so polling loops can distinguish "not indexed yet — keep waiting" (`NOT_FOUND`) from "bad id — stop" (`INVALID`) without parsing messages. The SDK's `waitForTransactionStatus` makes the same distinction. See `examples/bridge-usdt.js` for the recommended loop.

---

## Quote transaction validation

`validateQuoteTransaction` runs in `swidge()` after the fee-cap check and **before approval handling starts** — an untrusted target must be rejected before any allowance is built or sent, not merely before the bridge call.

Structural checks always run: `transactionRequest.to` must be a valid address, `data` must be hex, `value`/`gasLimit` must parse as BigInt. These are free and cannot false-positive.

The contract allowlist (`trustedContracts` config) is **opt-in** for two reasons:
1. **SDK parity** — the LI.FI SDK forwards `transactionRequest.to` to the wallet as-is (verified against `packages/sdk-provider-ethereum/src/core/tasks/`); TLS to `li.quest` is its trust boundary.
2. **Non-canonical deployments** — the Diamond lives at the canonical CREATE2 address on most chains, but not all (zkSync Era differs because its CREATE2 derivation differs). A default-on check would falsely reject valid routes on chains missing from the built-in list.

The built-in allowlist (`LIFI_DIAMOND_ADDRESSES` in `lifi-config.js`) holds the canonical address plus known exceptions, sourced from `github.com/lifinance/contracts/deployments`. Permit2 is pre-allowlisted because it appears as `estimate.approvalAddress` on permit-based routes. Per-chain entries *replace* the default (the canonical address is not valid on zkSync); user-supplied `trustedContracts` entries *extend* the set.

## Routing, chain coverage, and Bare runtime

**Routing options** (`order`, `allowBridges`, `denyBridges`, `allowDestinationCall`, `integrator`, `apiKey`) are constructor config values forwarded as query params or headers to the LI.FI `/quote` endpoint. They are pass-throughs: when omitted, nothing is sent and LI.FI's own defaults apply (e.g. `allowDestinationCall` defaults to `true` server-side, giving the widest route coverage). Setting `allowDestinationCall: false` filters out routes that need a destination-chain call, such as a destination-chain swap, reducing the chance of a `PARTIAL` status that leaves the user with an intermediary token. `slippage` is a per-call option in `SwidgeOptions` so different routes can use different tolerances without reconstructing the instance.

**Gasless is opt-in, not the default.** The module targets any WDK project, so it does not assume a paymaster-funded wallet. Integrations that cannot spend native tokens combine two options: `denyBridges: NATIVE_VALUE_BRIDGE_DENY_LIST` (an exported, maintained list of bridges known to require native value in the source transaction) filters such routes at quote time, and `allowNativeValue: false` rejects any remaining quote with `transactionRequest.value > 0` before approvals are sent. The two are deliberately atomic: the deny list is a routing preference, the execution guard is a safety check, and either can be used without the other.

**Chain coverage:** The `CHAINS` map in `lifi-config.js` covers 66 chains and exists for ergonomics (`'arbitrum'` over `42161`). It is not a gate — passing a raw numeric `toChain` bypasses the map entirely and works for any chain LI.FI supports, including ones added after this release. `getSupportedChains()` returns the live list directly from LI.FI.

**Bare runtime:** The `bare.js` entry point imports `bare-node-runtime` to polyfill the global environment. The module uses no Node.js-specific APIs (`http.request`, `Buffer`, `crypto.randomBytes`, etc.).
